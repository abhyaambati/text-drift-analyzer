# LLM Response Drift Analyzer 🚀

Ever wondered if your AI model is having an "off day"? Or if it's gradually changing its personality? We've built a tool that helps you keep an eye on your LLM's behavior and catch any unexpected changes before they become problems.
 

### 1. Advanced ML Implementation
- **State-of-the-Art NLP**: Leveraging sentence transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for semantic analysis
- **Statistical ML Methods**: 
  - KL divergence for distribution comparison
  - Robust anomaly detection using Median Absolute Deviation (MAD)
  - Statistical drift metrics for trend analysis
- **Feature Engineering**: 
  - Text embedding generation
  - Semantic similarity computation
  - Temporal feature extraction

### 2. ML Problem-Solving
- **Model Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of model behavior changes
- **Drift Detection**: Multiple approaches to identify semantic and statistical drift
- **Performance Metrics**: Comprehensive evaluation of model consistency
- **Anomaly Detection**: Statistical methods to identify unusual patterns

### 3. Data Science Pipeline
- **Data Processing**: Efficient handling of large text datasets
- **Statistical Analysis**: Advanced metrics for drift quantification
- **Visualization**: Interactive dashboards for ML insights
- **Evaluation**: Multiple metrics for model behavior assessment



### Tech Stack
- Python 3.x (because we love clean code)
- PyTorch (for the heavy lifting)
- Sentence Transformers (for understanding text)
- Dash/Plotly (for beautiful visuals)
- Pandas/Numpy (for data magic)
- Scikit-learn (for machine learning)
- SciPy (for scientific computing)
