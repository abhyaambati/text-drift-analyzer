# LLM Response Drift Analyzer üöÄ

Ever wondered if your AI model is having an "off day"? Or if it's gradually changing its personality? We've built a tool that helps you keep an eye on your LLM's behavior and catch any unexpected changes before they become problems.

## ML & Data Science Highlights ‚ú®

### 1. Advanced ML Implementation
- **State-of-the-Art NLP**: Leveraging sentence transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for semantic analysis
- **Statistical ML Methods**: 
  - KL divergence for distribution comparison
  - Robust anomaly detection using Median Absolute Deviation (MAD)
  - Statistical drift metrics for trend analysis
- **Feature Engineering**: 
  - Text embedding generation
  - Semantic similarity computation
  - Temporal feature extraction

### 2. ML Problem-Solving
- **Model Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of model behavior changes
- **Drift Detection**: Multiple approaches to identify semantic and statistical drift
- **Performance Metrics**: Comprehensive evaluation of model consistency
- **Anomaly Detection**: Statistical methods to identify unusual patterns

### 3. Data Science Pipeline
- **Data Processing**: Efficient handling of large text datasets
- **Statistical Analysis**: Advanced metrics for drift quantification
- **Visualization**: Interactive dashboards for ML insights
- **Evaluation**: Multiple metrics for model behavior assessment

## What Makes This Special? ‚ú®

### 1. Smart Drift Detection
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Using cutting-edge sentence transformers to spot when your AI starts talking differently
- **Deep Statistical Insights**: 
  - Track how much your AI's responses are changing
  - Spot unusual patterns in its behavior
  - Measure how consistent it stays over time
- **Early Warning System**: Catch potential issues before they become big problems

### 2. Live Dashboard That Speaks Your Language
- **Beautiful Visualizations**:
  - Watch drift patterns unfold in real-time
  - See how your AI's responses are distributed
  - Spot relationships between different metrics
- **At-a-Glance Metrics**:
  - How many responses we've analyzed
  - How much drift we're seeing
  - Whether things are getting better or worse
  - Any red flags we should know about

### 3. Data Made Simple
- **Built-in Testing**: Try it out with our sample data generator
- **Easy Data Handling**: Work with familiar CSV files
- **Smart Processing**: Handle big datasets without breaking a sweat
- **Progress Updates**: See exactly what's happening, when it's happening
